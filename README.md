# TaskFlow — Team Task Manager

A full-stack team task management app built with React, Node.js, Express, and MySQL.

## Tech Stack

### Frontend
| Technology | Version | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| React | ^18.2.0 | UI framework |
| React Router DOM | ^6.15.0 | Client-side routing |
| Axios | ^1.5.0 | HTTP requests to backend |
| Vite | ^5.0.0 | Build tool and dev server |
| CSS Modules | — | Component-scoped styles |

### Backend
| Technology | Version | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| Node.js | ≥18.x | Runtime |
| Express | ^4.18.2 | HTTP server and routing |
| mysql2 | ^3.6.0 | MySQL driver (promise-based) |
| bcryptjs | ^2.4.3 | Password hashing |
| jsonwebtoken | ^9.0.0 | JWT-based authentication |
| dotenv | ^16.0.3 | Environment variable management |
| cors | ^2.8.5 | Cross-origin request handling |

### Database
- **MySQL** (any version ≥ 5.7 or MySQL 8.x)
- Tables are auto-created on server startup via `initDB()` — no manual migration needed.

## Features

- User registration and login with JWT authentication (7-day token expiry)
- Create and manage projects
- Add / remove project members by email (admin-only)
- Role-based access: `admin` (full CRUD) and `member` (can only update status of tasks assigned to them)
- Create, update, and delete tasks with title, description, due date, priority (`low` / `medium` / `high`), and status (`todo` / `inprogress` / `done`)
- Assign tasks to project members
- Dashboard with aggregated stats: total tasks, by status, overdue count, and tasks per assignee
- React frontend served statically from Express in production
- Health check endpoint at `/api/health`

## Deployment Guide

### Deploy on Railway (Recommended)

The project includes a `railway.toml` with a pre-configured build and start command.

1. Push the project to a GitHub repository.

2. Go to [railway.app](https://railway.app) and create a new project.

3. Click **"Deploy from GitHub repo"** and select your repository.

4. Add a **MySQL** plugin from the Railway dashboard. Railway will auto-provision a MySQL instance and give you a `DATABASE_URL`.

5. In your Railway service's **Variables** tab, add:

```
JWT_SECRET=your_random_secret
NODE_ENV=production
CLIENT_URL=https://your-railway-domain.up.railway.app
```

6. Railway will automatically run:
   - Build: `cd client && npm install && npm run build && cd ../server && npm install`
   - Start: `cd server && node index.js`

7. Your app will be live at the Railway-provided URL.

## Notes

- In production, the React build (`client/dist`) is served as static files by Express. There is no need to run the Vite dev server.
- The database tables are created automatically on server startup — no migration tool is needed.
- JWT tokens expire after **7 days**. Adjust in `routes/auth.js` if needed.
- Task creation and deletion are restricted to project **admins**. Regular members can only change the `status` of tasks assigned directly to them.
